This is a Computer Graphics mini project executed as a part of the Computer Graphics course in college for 30% of the final marks. 

In this project, we make use of the OpenGL library and C++ programming language to visualize and simplify the working of the Prim's Algorithm.

Before execution, the OpenGL libraries GLUT and GL must be installed. GCC compiler must be installed.
The program can be run by executing the prims.cpp file by running the command 'cc prims.cpp -lglut -lGLU -lGL' in the command line.

All details of functions used and the inputs and outputs of the program are given in detail in the Report file.
